## 🎯 Game Rules

- On each turn, a player can:
  - 🎲 **Roll the dice** — the rolled number is added to their *current score*.
  - 🚫 If the player rolls a **1**, they lose all points from their *current score*, and the turn switches to the other player.
  - 💾 **Hold** — adds their *current score* to their *total score* and passes the turn to the next player.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game. 🏆
